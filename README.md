Youtube Selenium Test Automation
========
Small home project to improve myself when it comes to selenium-skills.
Selenium is an umbrella project encapsulating a variety of tools and
libraries enabling web browser automation.

## Requirements
This is a WIP. Only OSX with ChromeDriver is currently supported.
* [Java 8 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* `java` and `jar` on the PATH
* Selenium ChromeDriver must be installed beforehand (see https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver)
*. The OS running must be OSX 10.9, 10.10 or 10.11.


### Optional Requirements
* IDE such as intellij or eclipse will make set-up of project much easier.
